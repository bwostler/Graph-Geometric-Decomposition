Program input: A text file containing the adjacency matrix of a (multi)graph.

Program output: Several possibilities, depending on which functions you call.
You can get...

1. The geometric decomposition (represented as isomorphisms to S_n). More complex
groups that aren't symmetric groups (don't have a natural symmetric group action) 
are called "complex motifs" by the program.

2. The group orbits over the symmetric motifs (equivalence classes of vertices, i.e
the vertices that can be permuted onto one another in a symmetric motif without 
affecting network adjacency).

3. The size of the automorphism group.

4. A list of generators of the automorphism group, represented as permutations in 
cycle notation.

5. The number of generators of the automorphism group.

6. A plot of the graph and the orbits on each symmetric motif, distinguished by color.
Note that you can customize many properties of the plot, including whether to show 
vertex labels, edge weights, and what DPI the plot should be.

Each of these can be obtained by either calling their respective methods in the 
AutomorphismGroup class or by calling the method "decomposition" with "verbose = True".

=============

See the example scripts to understand how to implement AutomorphismGroup. Please note that 
unless you run your script in the same folder as "/bliss-0.73/," you'll have to specify 
the path to this folder when calling the decomposition method.

The program also contains two methods that may be useful to those interested in 
fractal and modular fractal graphs. For information on the method for generating 
fractal matrices, see [SAW17], and for modular fractal matrices, see [KRI17];
both in Aigaion.
