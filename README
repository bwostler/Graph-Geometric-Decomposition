========================================================
Autmorphism Geometric Decomposition Program (Geomdecomp)
========================================================

What is this program for?:

Finding a subset of the set of node clusters that can possibly exist on a 
graph to aid numerical simulations of cluster stability in large networks.

What are the dependencies?:

You'll need to install Sage(Math) (http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/installation/).
I highly recommend you do this on a linux-based machine and, if possible, put Sage
inside your PATH. However, if you don't have access to administrative rights, you 
can install Sage locally and follow the procedure below.

What do I have to do to use this program?:

1. Install Sage via their installation guide. It's relatively straightforward and 
automated. I recommend installing from their pre-built binaries.
2. Navigate to the directory that the folder 'geomdecomp' is located in via terminal.
If Sage is in your PATH, simple type 'sage geomdecomp.py'. If not, navigate to the 
directory where sage.sh is located (in your sage installation) and type 
'./sage DIRECTORY/TO/geomdecomp.py', replacing DIRECTORY/TO/ with the correct path on 
your computer.

NOTE: You may need to remake bliss inside 'DIRECTORY/TO/geomdecomp/bliss-0.73/'.
Simple navigate to the folder 'DIRECTORY/TO/geomdecomp/bliss-0.73/' and type 'make'.

This program was produced/tested using Sage 8.2 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 64bit.
